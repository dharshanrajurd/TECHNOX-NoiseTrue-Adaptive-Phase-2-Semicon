    This targets the over-smoothing problem directly: pixel/feature-position
    losses reward the model for averaging away texture it's unsure about,
    since a slightly-misplaced texture is still numerically close. Gram
    matrix loss doesn't care about position -- it only cares whether the
    right KIND of texture statistics are present, which pushes the model
    to keep committing to real texture instead of blurring it out.

    layers (relu1_x) pick up pixel/noise-level statistics, which is exactly
    what we DON'T want this loss keying on given the input is noisy."""
